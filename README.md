Create mock blockchains with varying ringsizes.
    
Intended to simulate one of the key aspects, ringsizes, of cryptonote-like blockchains in order to explore leakage of transaction information potentially impacting privacy or fungibility.

This code allows you to
- generate fake transactions
- with varying amounts of users
- with varying ringsizes
- different probabilities for creation of transactions
- different hashing power distributions
